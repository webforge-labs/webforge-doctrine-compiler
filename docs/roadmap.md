# Todos

the orm:create-entity command needs to: 
  1. create the entity file
  2. add a section to the compiler for the entity
    - ask questions for the entity name
    - ask question for the entity table
    - maybe ask questions for properties, constructor, etc
  3. run compile

Requirements: besser testing of interactive commands in testplate / console
